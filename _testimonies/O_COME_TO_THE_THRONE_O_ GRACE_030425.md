# O COME TO THE THRONE OF GRACE, 030425


I think some of you already knew I was in the thick of it by the time we had our prayer call together last night. Indeed I was - I had a model to build, take photos of and record a video for by this Monday and a lot of things went wrong.

Long story short, I found myself having to make complicated arrangements to get my model built in a short amount of time throughout the night. At the end, I was only gonna be able to properly assemble my model from 2am onwards (when we were gonna present our work from 9am onwards LOL) after already exhausting myself to cut a lot of pieces by hand and troubleshooting my 3D printed pieces for at least 6 hours on Sunday.

I was laughing at the absurd state of my situation at hand just thinking how much I’ve screwed up in such a short amount of time.

Because I had to pick up the pieces (no pun intended) at my friend’s house (whom I asked to help 3D print my stuff)  in the middle of the night, I decided to head home first so I could use my dad’s car to collect them and head back to school quickly to build the model.

At home, I was really comforted amidst my troubles. My mom provided me supper, I managed to have a refreshing warm shower and the weather was just so breezy and the neighbourhood was silent.
But I knew I had a whole ordeal to overcome and I think what’s worse than being deprived of comfort sometimes is making the choice to let go of them. And I knew that in that moment I had to persevere for the Lord’s goodness to come to fruition in my life.

For a brief moment of respite, I closed my eyes to doze off for about 15 minutes. Sitting in the darkness of my living room. When I opened them, I felt so weak being barely awake. All I could see was the altar where my mom left the lights on. There I was captivated by Our Lady. In an unexplained manner, the only thought my heart could conceive of was to ask our Blessed Mother, “Wah how much more must it have hurt for you to follow Christ…” But in hindsight, what I felt in those thoughts was a profound sense of awe for her. In awe as she stood underneath the spotlight wearing her crown, carrying Jesus in her hands. Beautifully adorned with gold. In her I was struck by what all her suffering amounted to, to share the glory of God in His entirety.

As I sobered up, I found myself feeling a sense of unexplainable peace and greater resolve for the road ahead. New found hope that I believed in so much more now.

The several hours that followed were no longer driven by anxiety or any zeal for suffering or the pride of myself but instead it was driven by love. A desire to make His dreams a reality in the little ways. Where I could join each piece together in wonder of His love and His gift of art. It was really the first time that exercising my vocation as a student in architecture felt like a prayer.

I was really blessed by Him throughout the night until the break of dawn through the presence of my partner (for pairwork). Who finished his part of the work so much earlier, rightfully earning his rest for the night yet he chose to stay and partake in my suffering. In which we shared the lord’s joy with one another as well as our neighbouring studio mates.

To look back at the chaos over the past 48 hours, I believe it was a humble miracle to walk with the Lord in these times. The outcome of the model was really beautiful and well received by my prof even with all the mess that it took to materialise it. I saw in this day perhaps a glimpse of what Mother Teresa meant when she said,

”I used to believe that prayer changes things, but now I know that prayer changes us and we change things.”

God truly is faithful la, I realise more and more that as much as it doesn’t look like it, we are just laying down the tracks for a train to move, to tag along on this crazy journey with a crazy friend.
